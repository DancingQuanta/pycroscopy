However that equation has partial derivatives (it depends on time and space) because it deals with finding the position of each point of the beam in a certain time, which cant make the problem too expensive computationally for our purposes. In our case, we have the advantage that we are only concerned about the position of the tip (which is the only part of the probe that will interact with the sample). As a consequence many researchers in AFM have successfully made approximations using a simple mass point model approximation [see ref. 2] like the one in figure 2 (with of course the addition of tip sample forces!  We will see more about this later).\n",

    "This looks totally unphysical! We were expecting to have a steady state oscillation of 60 nm and we got a huge oscillation that keeps growing. Can it be due to the scheme? The timestep that we have chosen is quite big with respect to the oscillation period. We have intentionally set it to ONLY 28 time steps per period (That could be the reason why the scheme can't capture the physics of the problem). That's quite discouraging. However the timestep is quite big and it really gets better as you decrease the time step. Try it! Reduce the time step and see how the numerical solution acquires an amplitude of 60 nm as the analytical one. At this point we can't state anything about accuracy before doing an analysis of error (we will make this soon). But first, let's try to analyze if another more efficient scheme can capture the physics of our damped harmonic oscillator even with this large time step."

    "It is very common in the field of probe microscopy to model the tip sample interactions through DMT contact mechanics. \n",
    "DMT stands for Derjaguin, Muller and Toporov who were the scientists that developed the model (see ref 1). This model uses Hertz contact mechanics (see ref 2) with the addition of long range tip-sample interactions. These long range tip-sample interactions are ascribed to intermolecular interactions between the atoms of the tip and the upper atoms of the surface, and include mainly the contribution of van de Waals forces and Pauli repulsion from electronic clouds when the atoms of the tip meet closely the atoms of the surface. Figure 2 displays a force vs distance curve (FD curve) where it is shown how the forces between the tip and the sample behave with respect to the separation. It can be seen that at positive distances the tip starts \"feeling\" attraction from the tip (from the contribution of van der Waals forces) where the slope of the curve is positive and at some minimum distance ($a_0$) the tip starts experiencing repulsive interactions arising from electronic cloud repulsion (area where the slope of the curve is negative and the forces are negative). At lower distances, an area known as \"contact area\" arises and it is characterized by a negative slope and an emerging positive force."

    "Check that we have two sinusoidals. The one in green (the output) is the response signal of the tip (the tip trajectory in time) while the blue one (the input) is the cosinusoidal driving force that we are using to excite the tip. When the tip is excited in free air (without tip sample interactions) the phase lag between the output and the input is 90 degrees. You can test that with the previous code by only changing the position of the base to a high-enough position that it does not interact with the sample. However in the above plot the phase lag is less than 90 degrees. Interestingly the phase can give relative information about the material properties of the sample. There is a well-developed theory of this in tapping mode AFM and it's called phase spectroscopy. If you are interested in this topic you can read reference 1.\n",
    "Also look at the above plot and see that the response amplitude is no longer 60 nm as we initially set (in this case is near 45 nm!). It means that we have experienced a significant amplitude reduction due to the tip sample interactions.\n",
    "Besides with the data acquired we are able to plot a Force-curve as the one shown in Figure 3. It shows the attractive and repulsive interactions of our probe with the surface.\n",
