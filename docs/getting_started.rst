Getting Started
---------------
* Follow `these instructions <./install.html>`_ to install pycroscopy
* See how we use pycroscopy for our scientific research in these `jupyter notebooks <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks/>`_.
* See `journal publications <./papers_conferences.html>`_ that used pycroscopy.
* We have also compiled a list of `handy tutorials <./external_guides.html>`_ on basic / prerequisite topics such as programming in python, data analytics, machine learning, etc.
* See our `examples <./auto_examples/index.html>`_ to get started on using and writing your own pycroscopy functions
* We already have `many translators <./translators.html>`_ that transform data from popular microscope data formats to pycroscopy compatible HDF5 files.
    * We also have `tutorials  <./auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_numpy_translator.html>`_ to get you started on importing your other data to pycroscopy.
* Details regarding the definition, implementation, and guidelines for pycroscopy's `data format <./data_format.html>`_ for HDF5 are also available.
* Please see our document on the `organization of pycroscopy <./package_organization.html>`_ to find out more on what is where and why.
* We can guide you to convert your file formats into pycroscopy compatible HDF5 files and help you get started with data analysis.
* If you are interested in contributing and are looking for topics we are / will work on, please look at our `To Do <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/ToDo.rst>`_ page
* Have questions? See our `FAQ <./faq.html>`_ to see if we have already answered them.
* Need help or need to get in touch with us? See our `contact <./contact.html>`_ information.

Guide for python newbies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the python novices by a python novice - **Nick Mostovych, Brown University**


1. Learn about the `philosophy, purpose, etc. of pycroscopy <./about.html>`_.
2. Get an idea of the different resources available by reading the `getting started <./getting_started.html>`_ section
3. Watch the video on `installing Anaconda <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk>`_ from the `Tutorials on Basics <./external_guides.html>`_ page
4. Follow instructions on the `installation <./install.html>`_ page to install Anaconda.
5. Watch the `video tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk>`_ from the ``Jupyter Notebooks`` section in `the Tutorials on Basics <./external_guides.html>`_ page
6. Read the whole `Tutorial on Basics page <./external_guides.html>`_
7. Play with python in a jupyter notebook. If you are ever confused with the usage of a function or class, just hit the ``Tab`` key after typing the name of your function. E.g. - type ``px.PycroDataset(``. Hit ``Tab`` twice or four times.
8. Read `Pycroscopy Data and File Format <./data_format.html>`_ This is very important and highlights the advantages of using pycroscopy. I think this should be read over 2-3 times at least for a new user.
9. Do tutorial on the `Primer to HDF5 and h5py <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_h5py.html>`_
10. Do tutorial on the `PycroDataset <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_pycro_dataset.html>`_.  Use PycroDatasets whenever possible to simplify your tasks.
11. Do tutorial on `Utilities for reading Pycroscopy HDF5 files <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_hdf_utils_read.html>`_
12. Do tutorial on `Utilities for handling data types and transformations
13. Do tutorial: Formalizing Data processing
14. Look at source code for Process Class
