0. The What and Why?
--------------------
A python package for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy,
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
Classes implemented here are ported to a high performance computing platform at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

1. The Who?
-----------
This project begun largely as the effort of materials scientists and physicists at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (ORNL)
to implement a python library for their own use and the benefit of CNMS users and hopefully the wider community of scientists that
do imaging and advanced characterization of materials.

2. The Structure?
-----------------
The package structure is quite simple, with 4 modules: io, processing, analysis, viz.
